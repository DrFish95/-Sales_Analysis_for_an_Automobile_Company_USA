## DATA PRE-PROCESSING
#### DATA LOADING
## importing all the necessary python packages 
```python
# solution 

import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print('the package has been successfully imported')

```
```python
bikes_df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/office/Documents/_EXCLUSIVE DATA SCIENCE BOOT CAMP_STUDENT FOLDER/_DATASET/bikes.csv")

bikes_df.head()

```
# DATA MODIFICATION
```python
# (1). Adding the following 3 extra columns to pansdas Dataframe:  bikes_df







# TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 





# SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 



# Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)



bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


bikes_df.head()

```
## DATA ANALYSIS
#### DATA FILTERING
 # Filtering out only the data relevant to solving the problem statement
 ```python
is_usa = bikes_df["CustomerCountry"] == "United States"

is_bike = bikes_df["ProductCategory"] == "Bikes" 

bikes_in_the_us = bikes_df[(is_usa) & (is_bike)]

bikes_in_the_us.head()

```
#### DATA AGREGATION
```python
# agregating the total profit by states in the united states for bike sales

total_profit_by_states = bikes_in_the_us.pivot_table(values = "Profit", index = "CustomerState",aggfunc = np.sum)
 
total_profit_by_states

```
## DATA SORTING
```python
# sorting the agregated data,

# in order according to the top most profitable states


total_profit_by_states.sort_values("Profit", ascending = False)

## RESULTS
```python
 #Top_Most-Profitable 5 States for a Bike business in the United State ?
top_5_most_profitable_state_USA_bike =total_profit_by_states.sort_values("Profit", ascending = False).head()
top_5_most_profitable_state_USA_bike

```
## DATA VISUALIZATION
```python
# visualizing the result

top_5_most_profitable_state_USA_bike.plot(kind = "bar")

# adding a little and label to the plot 

plt.title("The top 5 most profitable states for Bike product in the Us")

plt.ylabel("Total profit in Million Dolars")
plt.xlabel("States")

# showing the plot

plt.show()

```
